SpringBoot_Employee_Management

So Here is my Employee_Management Project in which I have used Spring(Boot) to perform the CRUD operations.
The UI which is used here is Thymeleaf and for adding the dependencies I have used Maven.
I have Used Spring Data JPA to integrate my application with the database i.e. MySql.

In forth-coming days, I will be making my application more secured by adding spring-security and oAuth-2 library.
